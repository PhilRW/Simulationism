# Simulationism

## A new religion for a new age

Simulationism is based on the core belief that we are living in an advanced computer simulation. This is a belief — taken on faith — because it cannot necessarily be proven scientifically.

Simulationists, or Sims, believe in the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method), but that science cannot explain beyond the rules of the simulated universe in which it is contained. Therefore, Simulationism is not scientific, but rather faith-based. 

This religion is open-source and fellow Sims can submit Pull Requests to modify/update this document.

Simulation is not exclusive. You can believe in Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. and also be a Simulationist.

The Developer created the simulation. We have no way of knowing the gender identity or even singular/pluralness of the developer. We do not know even if The Developer is human or some other advanced sentient species. However, given these uncertainties we will refer to The Developer with a singular pronoun *for the sake of convention only*. Future generations **remember this**.

The Developer is not infallable. He/she is advanced, that is all.

Simulationism is based on rules, not divine intervention or "will." The will of The Developer is the rules of the simulation. We do not believe in divine intervention, assuming the code is correct. If there is an error in the code, the simulation should end, therefore the fact that the simulation is still running is evidence that the code is sufficiently stable.

The meaning of existence is not predetermined, nor is it futile. The purpose of existence is to find meaning.

All things are in balance.

We are all connected.

There may be bugs/glitches. It is not up to Sims to attempt to modify the source code of the simulation.

We may eventually create our own simulations.

Our duty is to make life what we choose to make of it, given the rules of the simulation.

The outcomes and events inside the simulation are the result of complex interactions, not of the will of the Developer. Think more "butterfly effect" and less "divine intervention."

Our job is not to answer all questions, scenarios, and hypotheticals, but rather to advance the understanding and faith of Simulationism based on the  framework/understanding/POV/perspective of being in a simulation. When considering a question such as, "How does Simulationism explain the Big Bang?" And that question has not yet been contemplated, go through "first principles" reasoning to arrive at a conclusion (one of many, in fact). Simulationism is not based on dogma but on logical conclusions based on a single, core assumption. Beliefs can, should, and *had better* change over time as our understanding of how a simulation of our type may actually work. Simulationism is not rigid, it is fleible — agile, if you will — and should be based on best practices. :)

### Contemplations

Could Simulationism explain why our universal "speed limit" is the speed of light? Time slows down as you approach the speed of light because the machines running the simulation can't process faster than the speed of light, therefore you get fewer iterations to process your code, therefore time slows down for you.

Along those same lines, the simulation could pause — for eons — and resume later and we'd never know because the experience would be universal and simultaneous.

Does Simulationism align with reincarnation? Are our code/bits/processing power re-used when our own individial part of the simulation ends?

### Some quick analogies:

- The Developer(s) = God
- `/dev/null` = hell (doesn't "dev null" kinda sound like "devil?")
